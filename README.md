Strong Password Generator
This repository contains a Python script for generating strong, secure passwords. The generated passwords are highly resistant to cracking attempts, making them ideal for protecting sensitive information.

Features
Generates a strong password with a customizable length (recommended minimum length: 12 characters).
Ensures a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Shuffles the order of characters for added security.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Installation

Clone this repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/strong-password-generator.git

Navigate to the project directory:
bash
cd strong-password-generator
Usage
Run the script directly from the command line:

bash
python generate_password.py
You can customize the password length by modifying the length parameter in the generate_strong_password function:

python
generate_strong_password(length=16)  # Adjust length as needed
Example Output
When you run the script, it will print a randomly generated strong password, for example:

Generated Strong Password: Z6G/U;?c)nAHTW
Code Explanation
The script uses Python's random and string libraries to ensure a diverse mix of characters. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it works:

Character Sets: The script defines four character sets (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters).
Password Construction: At least one character from each set is included to ensure a balanced mix.
Random Filling and Shuffling: The remaining characters are selected randomly, then shuffled to make the password unpredictable.
Customization
You can adjust the length parameter in the generate_strong_password function to generate longer passwords for added security.
